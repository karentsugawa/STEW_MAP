Natural Areas Conservancy,"Stewardship means an ongoing commitment to a unique and special place, to improve it not just for your own enjoyment, but for people in your community or people that you don’t even know.",Hunter Armstrong
LUNGS (Loisaida United Neighborhood Gardens),Stewardship is a word that can give the impression that we own the land. I do not believe anyone owns this earth.  I think that we are part of it and we have a responsibility to respect it and help all creatures and living things sustain themselves.,Charles Krezell
Protectors of Pine Oak Woods,Stewardship means to me that we take the time to treat the land we live on ethically,Don Recklies
Warren St. Marks Community Garde,"Stewardship means recognizing the gifts that you see before you, recognizing that others have protected it in the past, and holding hands with them from the past on into the future to preserve and enhance something that is precious.",Andrea Kannapel
The People's Own Organic Power (POOP) Project,"Stewardship makes me think of being the captain of a ferryboat.  It’s about helping everyone arrive at their destination safely.  In this way, we are all responsible for each other and not just out for ourselves.  It’s not someone else’s job, it’s our job. We can be stronger and more resilient and live in a world that is beautiful.",Shawn Shafner
Lotus Garden,"The community garden is really a gift.  A larger gift to the environment, but also a personal gift.  A reminder that a handful of committed people can make change.",Ken Karpel
Trout Unlimited - Trout in the Classroom,"I was planting trees with a high school group to improve our watershed for fish habitat.  Many of the students came from different countries and one of them exclaimed, “Miss Lilli, I really love this. It’s so fun. It reminds me of where I come from.”  I asked, “Where is that?”  He replied, “The Dominican Republic.” Another student shouted, “Miss Lilli! This is amazing. I love this. It reminds me of my home.”  “That’s great, where is home?” I asked.  He said, “China.”  We were in New York City’s watershed. It is still amazing to me that doing this work together gave these students the opportunity to make the connection between their new home and their old.",Lillit Genovesi
Randall's Island Park Alliance,"One of my favorite things that we do is take students into the water wearing waders and then pull a net to see what’s actually in the water.  I especially like working with adults, because their ideas and opinions about the estuary are pretty well-established. The will say, “There is nothing alive in there!” But when they see that not only are things alive, but there is an abundance of wildlife, it’s really a special moment for us all.",Chris Girgenti
"Coney Island Beautification Project, Inc.","When we started our work, we decided that environmental justice should be a ‘kitchen table’ conversation instead of making a big speech and a rally.  It should start as a conversation to find out what is important to people where they live. A lot of people have other things going on, so what I need to do first is to find out what matters to them.  And then we can begin.",Pamela Pettyjohn
Promenade Garden Conservancy,"I think community engagement is what makes the city.  All the city planning, the government, the roads, and the hospitals, all those things are important--but what really makes a city a vibrant, safe, and interesting place to live is when you have a community that actually cares about it.",Koren Valk
8th Street Block Association,It’s so therapeutic to be involved in beautifying the world,Joyce Jed
New York Botanical Garden,"My hope is that we continue to have younger as well as the older generations involved in stewardship efforts. People should be able to be touched by nature in their neighborhoods, particularly in the form of community garden spaces, which provide clean air, fresh food, connection and continued opportunities to be invested and inspired.",Ursula Chanse
We Run Brownsville,"My hope for the future of this work is that decision-making does not happen in a silo.  There  is so much to be gained through collaboration, where people who use parks in Brownsville go to Flushing and vice-versa, and we talk about similarities, challenges, and exchange ideas in ways that don’t happen as often at City Hall. I want elected officials who are aware that collaborations can only happen if they come into communities and talk to people where they are.",Dionne Grayman
New Yorkers for Parks,"I’m confronted with this network of stewards every day and I’m really grateful for it, because it’s moving to see how much New Yorkers care for their neighborhoods and want to make a difference. I hope that doesn’t stop. I hope that well of grit and inspiration and determination never dries up, because it’s really powerful what I’ve seen everyday people accomplish from every neighborhood across the five boroughs. So, I hope that’s what the future holds: we need more stewards and more advocates.",Emily Walker
Newtown Creek Alliance,"I would like to see a lot more people that are living and working here develop personal relationships with the waterways. There are so many really interesting shorelines and waterways that have different characteristics and environments. Thinking of the country as a whole, its unique how many New Yorkers have access to this amazing estuary system, with the diversity of animals that have been here for thousands of years, the tides, the currents and the movement of the water. The city was built here because of the waterways; we are city islands.",Willis Elkins
